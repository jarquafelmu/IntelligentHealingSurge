# Intelligent Healing Surge

Based on the Dnd Fifth Edition healing surge variant, this script allows a user to quickly perform a healing surge while ensuring that a healing surge can actually be performed.

## Commands (GM only)
* **!ihs -initialize**: creates healing surge, long rest and short rest macros already configured so that all players can see them and set as token actions.

## Commands (must have token selected)
* **!ihs -surge**: performs a healing surge.
* **!ihs -short**: performs a short rest, restoring 1/4th the character's hit dice, minimum of one.
* **!ihs -long**: performs a long rest, restoring all of a character's hit dice.
* **!ihs -exhaust**: exhaust the use of a healing surge until a long or short rest is used. Typically not called directly.
